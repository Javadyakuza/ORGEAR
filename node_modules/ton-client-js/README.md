# TON Javascript Client SDK
Shared JavaScript TON Labs Client Library  
![npm publish](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-client-js/workflows/npm%20publish/badge.svg)  

The JavaScript SDK implements the client-side libraries used by applications working with TON OS GraphQL API.  
This package supports web (browser), mobile-web, and server (Node.js) clients. 

Javascript SDK is distributed via npm package:   
[common js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ton-client-js)

**Attention!** Because the JS library uses pre-compiled [core sdk rust library](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK), you need to 
install it via platform-dependable packages that will also link pre-compiled rust core to your project:

[node-js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ton-client-node-js)  
[web package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ton-client-web-js)  
[react-native package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ton-client-react-native-js)  

To get started using TON Javascript SDK, see [Add SDK to your Application](https://docs.ton.dev/86757ecb2/p/61b5eb-nodejs).
