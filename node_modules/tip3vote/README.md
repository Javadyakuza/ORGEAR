TIP3 Token

# About the project

This project helps you to create your first [TIP-3](https://docs.venom.foundation/build/development-guides/how-to-create-your-own-fungible-tip-3-token/fungible-tokens-in-venom-network) token for Venom blockchain.

What is TIP-3?
Just as ERC-20 is the most popular standard in the Ethereum network, TIP-3 assumes the same role in the Venom network. TIP-3 was designed to match the distributed system design of the Venom network and is cost-effective for its fee-paying model.

TIP-3 provides the following functionalities

- transfer tokens from one account to another
- get the current token balance of an account
- get the total supply of the token available on the network
- mint and burn tokens

You can find more info about TIP3 token in our [documentation](https://docs.venom.foundation/build/development-guides/how-to-create-your-own-fungible-tip-3-token/fungible-tokens-in-venom-network)

> **NOTE:** We highly recommend using [locklift](https://github.com/broxus/locklift/) as a development environment analog of Hardhat or Truffle in Venom/Everscale world.

# Project structure

Below you will find info about the project structure and the purpose of the main directories and files.

## `./contracts`

Directory for smart contracts.


## `locklift.config.ts`

Locklift config file. You can find the basic layout [here](https://docs.venom.foundation/build/development-guides/setting-up-the-venom-smart-contract-development-environment/#configuration)

## `scripts`

Directory for migrations scripts to deploy and set up your contracts.

## `test`

Directory for tests.

# Getting started

After setting up the project with `yo venom-scaffold`, you should already have a project ready for testing and deployment.

First, let's check configs at `locklift.config.ts` [file](#lockliftconfigts). Be sure that you provide the correct settings for all required networks.

Further, let's verify the token's settings in `scripts/00-deploy.ts` file:

```
ROOT_OWNER_ADDRESS - Address of the contract root owner (String)
REMAINING_GAS_TO - `Address to send the remaining gas (String)
NAME - The name of your token. For example `'Awesome TIP3 token'` (String)
SYMBOL - The symbol of your token. For example `'AWESOME-TIP3-TOKEN'` (String)
INITIAL_SUPPLY_TO - Address of initial token supply recipient (String)
INITIAL_SUPPLY - The number of tokens that will be issued immediately after deployment (String)
DECIMALS - The number of decimals that your token should have (Number)
DISABLE_MINT - Disables additional emission of tokens (Boolean)
DISABLE_BURN_BY_ROOT - Disables tokens burning (Boolean)
PAUSE_BURN - Temporarily disables token burning (Boolean)
```

After you check all settings, we are ready to [build](#build-contracts), [test](#test-contracts), and [deploy](#deploy-contracts) contracts.

## Build contracts

```bash
npm run build
```

## Test contracts

To test contracts locally, we need to run the [local node](#local-node).

```bash
npm run run:local-node
```

To run tests on the venom testnet, ensure you have added a giver for that network in `locklift.config.ts`.

```bash
npm run test:local
npm run test:testnet
```

## Deploy contracts

```bash
# deploy on the testnet
npm run deploy:testnet

# deploy on the mainnet
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

## Mint/Burn tokens

Additionally, you can run scripts to mint or burn tokens if you specify `DISABLE_MINT` and `DISABLE_BURN_BY_ROOT` to `false`.

```bash
# mint
npm run mint:testnet
npm run mint:mainnet

# burn
npm run burn:testnet
npm run burn:mainnet
```

## Local node

[Local node](https://hub.docker.com/r/tonlabs/local-node) is a pre-configured Docker image with a Ganache-like local blockchain designed for dapp debugging and testing.

The container exposes the specified 80 port with nginx, which proxies requests to /graphql to GraphQL API. You can access graphql endpoint at `http://localhost/graphql`

```bash
# run
npm run run:local-node

# stop
npm run stop:local-node
```
