# OrGear

OrGear is a DAO builder platform built on top of the Venom blockchain, using T-Sol. It helps individuals build and manage their own DAOs.

## Overview

OrGear provides several benefits over other networks, including increased scalability, lower transaction fees, and enhanced security. The core contracts of the platform are developed in T-Sol and interacted with and tested using TS and Locklift libraries.
this project also use the TIP3VOTE contract standard which is developed by us, to define the membership of the DAO participators.

## Features

- Scalability: OrGear is built on top of the Venom blockchain, which provides greater scalability than other blockchain networks.
- Lower transaction fees: Transactions on the Venom network have lower fees compared to other networks, making it more cost-effective to use.
- Security: Built using T-Sol programming language, OrGear is designed to be highly secure.
